# ADK Comic Pipeline

This repository contains an agentic pipeline for generating comic books, built using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Vertex AI**.

It is based on the solution to the codelab: [Create a low-code agent with ADK visual builder](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/create-low-level-agent-with-ADK-visual-builder)

## Features

- **Automated Scripting**: Generates creative comic scripts and character manifests from high-level prompts.
- **Intelligent Panelization**: Breaks down scripts into exactly 8 storyboarded panels.
- **AI Image Synthesis**: Generates 16:9 images for each panel using Vertex AI.
- **HTML Assembly**: Compiles the final artwork and script into a responsive HTML comic book.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Scripts included for deploying agents to Google Cloud Run.
- **Low-Code Interface**: Use the ADK Builder for visual agent development.

## Project Structure

- `Agent1/`: A basic agent featuring a Google Search tool. Uses `root_agent.yaml`.
- `Agent2/`: An agent focused on image generation using sub-agents. Uses `root_agent.yaml` and `sub_agent_*.yaml`.
- `Agent3/`: The primary comic pipeline implementation.
  - `root_agent.yaml`: The Studio Director agent that manages the pipeline.
  - `comic_pipeline_agent.yaml`: Orchestrates the `SequentialAgent` workflow.
  - `tools/`: Custom Python tools for image generation and file handling.
- `images/`: Directory where intermediate panel images are stored.
- `output/`: The final output directory containing `comic.html` and assets.

## Scripts & Utilities

- `agent_builder`: Launches the ADK Builder UI (accessible via browser) for visual agent design.
- `myadk`: A convenience wrapper for the `adk` CLI tool.
- `comic.sh`: Starts a local web server (port 8080) to view the generated comic.
- `deploycloudrun.py`: Automates deployment to Google Cloud Run, including IAM and Service Account setup.
- `fix_comic.py`: Manual utility to regenerate the `comic.html` with a default story (Momotaro).
- `init.sh`: Comprehensive setup script to configure the GCP project, enable APIs, and install dependencies.
- `set_env.sh` / `set_adc.sh`: Helpers to set environment variables and refresh Application Default Credentials.

## Makefile Commands

- `make run`: Runs `adk web .` to start the ADK development server.
- `make web`: Starts `adk web` on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).
- `make clean`: Removes log files, generated images, and temporary cache directories.
- `make test`: Runs `fix_comic.py` to validate the HTML generation.
- `make deploy`: Deploys the project using `deploycloudrun.py`.
- `make comic`: Launches a server specifically for the `output/` directory on port 8000.

## How it Works (Agent3)

The system uses a `Studio Director` agent (`root_agent.yaml`) that delegates to a `SequentialAgent` (`comic_pipeline_agent.yaml`), coordinating four specialized stages:
1. **Scripting Agent**: Narrative and Character Architect.
2. **Panelization Agent**: Cinematographer and Storyboarder.
3. **Image Synthesis Agent**: Technical Artist and Asset Generator.
4. **Assembly Agent**: Frontend Developer for final packaging.

## Known Bugs & Workarounds

*   **Environment Variables**: After editing `.env`, run `source .env` or `./set_env.sh` to update your shell.
*   **YAML Nesting**: The ADK CLI may nest YAML configurations in subdirectories incorrectly. They must be moved to the root of the respective agent's directory.
*   **Issue Tracking**: See [google/adk-python Issue #4134](https://github.com/google/adk-python/issues/4134).

## Getting Started

1.  **Initialize Project**: Run `./init.sh` to set up your Google Cloud project, enable necessary APIs, and install dependencies.
2.  **Verify Environment**: Ensure `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` are set in the `.env` file.
3.  **Run Pipeline**: Execute the comic creation pipeline for Agent3:
    ```bash
    adk run Agent3 --input "Create me a comic about a space explorer on a neon planet."
    ```
4.  **View Results**: Run `./comic.sh` and open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Deployment

To deploy an agent (default Agent1) to Google Cloud Run:
```bash
make deploy
```
*Note: Edit `deploycloudrun.py` to change the default target agent.*
